# Todo List Exercise

Please create a database and a web-based .NET API for a simple todo list application. This exercise should take approximately 1&ndash;2 hours, and is not expected to be perfect. Most importantly, it should demonstrate your skill set, and give us a better idea of how you approach problems and construct solutions.

Feel free to use any resources that you would normally have at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.), and do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com) if you have any questions.
